                    <h2>Kay</h2>
                    <p>
                        Exhange student from Berlin, Germany.<br>
                        Currently completing a master's degree in computer science.<br>
                        I am someone who harbors a deep passion and appreciation for music in all its forms. For me,
                        there are no boundaries or limitations when it comes to musical genres. Whether it's the complex
                        harmonies of classical compositions, the soulful rhythms of jazz, or the energetic beats of
                        electronic music each style offers a unique window into the vast world of musical expression. My
                        playlist is as diverse as the spectrum of music itself,
                        reflecting my belief that every genre has its own beauty and significance. <br>
                        I find joy in the rich tapestry of sounds, rhythms, and melodies that span across different
                        cultures and
                        traditions.<br>
                        My love for music is not confined to a single type; instead, it's a celebration of
                        the diversity and richness that music, in its many forms, brings to our lives.
