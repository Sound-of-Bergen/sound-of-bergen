           <p>
          Sound of Bergen was born out of genuine curiosity about Bergen's vibrant music scene. The starting point was interviews with artists conducted at Hoyden Festival 2023, and it also included performances by other artists in Bergen as well as interviews with key figures in the music industry.<br><br>

All videos were produced on a voluntary basis as part of Bergen Student TV (BSTV). This website was created as a university project at the University of Bergen in December 2023 and served as the final project for the course DIKULT203.<br><br>

Sound of Bergen is an exploration of Bergen's remarkable music scene and aims to answer the question: Why is the music scene in Bergen so strong and exceptional?<br><br>

Among the dedicated people behind this project is Maria, the main organizer and BSTV reporter, who also played a crucial role in creating the website. In addition, Maicej, Emilio, Anniken, Selin and Ablu worked as BSTV cameramen, while Sophie and Kai contributed to the development of the website.
