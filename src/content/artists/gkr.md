Originally from Reykjav√≠k, Gaukur moved to Bergen a few years ago to pursue his musical ambitions. Known for his electrifying live performances, Gaukur captivates audiences with his energy and transcends language barriers despite his Icelandic lyrics.


His songs, which he performs in the first person, give a very personal insight. Gaukur believes in the power of the personal experience of his music and emphasizes that it should be felt rather than explained.


He encourages listeners to interpret the music in their own way to ensure a truly immersive experience. Don't miss the opportunity to discover his music!


Gaukur is currently working on a new EP - GKR 2, a journey that BSTV documented in a short film. Stay tuned for this behind-the-scenes look at his creative process and to know more about Gaukur!
