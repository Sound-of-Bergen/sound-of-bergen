					Gaukur, originally hailing from Reykjav√≠k, made the move to Bergen a few years ago to pursue his
					music career. Specializing in Icelandic Hip Hop, he stands as one of the pioneers of this genre in
					Iceland. His live performances are notably energetic, drawing audiences in despite the Icelandic
					lyrics. With a first-person narrative, his lyrics offer a personal perspective. Gaukur believes that
					experiencing his music is key; there's no need for explanations. He insists that people should feel
					it in their own way; otherwise, they might miss out. Don't miss the chance to listen to his music!
					Currently, he's in the process of creating a new EP, and BSTV has captured this journey in a
					forthcoming short documentary. Stay tuned!
