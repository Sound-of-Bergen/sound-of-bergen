					Bergen-based band Atari were formed during their time at the Grieg Academy and have developed a unique sound that defies easy categorization. Their music, often described as neo-soul, weaves together elements of rock, jazz, indie and soulful lyrics to create their own sonic identity.<br>

					Since their debut album 'Sweet and Sour', Atari have garnered attention with their captivating performances at Norway's premier showcase festivals, including Vill Vill Vest (2023) and Trondheim Calling (2024).<br>

					Discover the essence of Atari in an insightful interview where you can learn more about their creative process and inspirations.
